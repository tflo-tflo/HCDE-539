# Terminology

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZ

**Amp:** `A`, 1 amp = 1 coulomb per 1 second.

**Coulomb:** Unit of electric charge, `C`. A coulomb is holds the equivalent charge of 6.242 * 10^18 electrons. We use coulombs because one elecron's charge is miniscule (equivalent to -1.602 * 10^-19 C).

**Conductors:** Low levels of resistance/high conductivity, such as copper, gold, and silver.

**Current:** `I`, the flow of charged particles through a conductor, measured in amps.

**Diode:** A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance). It has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.

**Insulators:** Materials with high levels of resistance/low conductivity.

**Ohm's Law:** Linear relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. To calculate the current; `I = V/R`.

**Resistance:** `R`, measured in ohms (Î©).

**Resistors:** Slows down electrons due to the atomic makeup of a material. Electrons in the current are colliding with atoms and other electrons, which not slows down the entire current, but can also create a byproduct through the collisions, such as heat or light. Materials that have high resistance are called insulators. The level of resistance depends on the material, size, diameter, length, temperature, etc., of the conductor.

**Voltage:** Electromotive force. Difference in electric potential between two points. The higher the voltage, the higher the number of electrons getting pushed into the current. Measured in volts, denoted by a `V`. One volt is equivalent to 1 joule per 1 coulomb. 1 joule is equal to 1 Newton per 1 meter. 1 Newton is equivalent to the force needed to push a kilogram of mass (e.g. an apple) 1 meter per second squared. Without voltage, electrons move randomly, voltage pushes electrons *through* a circuit.
